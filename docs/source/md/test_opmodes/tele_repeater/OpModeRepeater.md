# OpModeRepeater

To run the autonomous recording, you need to run the `TeleOpCopyRunner` class. This will run the recording and will not stop until you stop it or the 30 second timer runs out on autonomous modes.

Thats it! You can now run the recording and it will run the same way as it did in the teleop mode.
