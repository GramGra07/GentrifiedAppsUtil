Easy to setup and use
- use RR tuning and Pedro tuning with constraint generation
Multitude of movement types
- move to
- local steps (back, forward, right)
- LATER: splines
Parametric and time based callbacks
Coord system
- (0,0) in middle with red side being +x
Deceleration
Path completion should be heading (rotational) or position (translational)
Smooth path state system?
"On the fly approach" should always reach the target position (+- tolerance) then "not busy", if off, should automatically correct, if shoved should correct (movement,rotation vector calculated every loop)
Heading, translational pids
Zero power movement on braking
Builder interpolation for easy creation
