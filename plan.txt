Project Guidelines:
Add things that will help you next season. The idea is to make you have some stake in it, so you use more
Focus on usability
ABSOLUTELY NO AI
Use Java OR Kotlin
Project files will be written in branches titled with your first name
Write one packager (includes multiple other classes in the library)
- idea: package loop time manager and init movement controller
Write multiple "useful" (math or facilitation) classes
- idea: Command Base
- required: 
  - test cases
  - dox (written in md)
Optional - Generator for subsystem/etc
Optional - One vision class
Make a branch of your DECODE season, version it to use this Library using things in the dox as well as things hidden

Side project:
- Advance config creator to automatically get IMU/CameraSerial num
  - Maybe read from a scan file?

Freshman Project:
- CTM (make a project)
  - quiz?
  - read lib
  - branch and change to use lib (ambitious?)

Group climbing/social?
