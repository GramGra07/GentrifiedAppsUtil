Project Guidelines:
Add things that will help you next season. The idea is to make you have some stake in it, so you use more
Focus on usability
Use Java OR Kotlin
Project files will be written in branches titled with your first name
Write one packager (includes multiple other classes in the library)
- idea: package loop time manager and init movement controller
Write multiple "useful" (math or facilitation) classes
- idea: ility
- required: 
  - test cases
  - dox (written in md)
Make a branch of your DECODE season, version it to use this Library using things in the dox as well as things hidden
