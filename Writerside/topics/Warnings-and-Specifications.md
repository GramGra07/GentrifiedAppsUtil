# Warnings and Specifications

All the repeater does is track what power is given in each direction at any given time, this is not accurate enough to be used as a complex autonomous creation technique as it relies specifically on time and no external input.

This could be very useful for an extremely simple and quick autonomous mode to create, for instance in 24-25 game Into the Deep, you could park in the observation zone for 3 points. This would be an effective use case because you could technically create the opmode day of competition and guarantee the 3 points every time.

Essentially, this is a very simple and effective way to create a quick autonomous mode that is not very complex. It is not recommended to use this for anything more complex than a simple parking or scoring autonomous mode.
