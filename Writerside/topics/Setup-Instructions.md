# Setup Instructions

Start by simply cloning the repository to your local machine in Android Studio.

File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> [https://github.com/GramGra07/HeatseekerSimulator](https://github.com/GramGra07/HeatseekerSimulator)

After waiting for the project to load, you will need to sync the project with Gradle files. This can be done by clicking the "Sync Project with Gradle Files" (elephant with an arrow) button in the top right corner of Android Studio.

After the project is synced, make sure you see main as the run configuration as shown below:

Then, simply wait for it to build and run the project. You should see a window pop up with the simulator running.

Only paste the codes for actions as in ```.addWaypoint()``` and not the ```PathBuilder```
