# OpModeTracker

The OpModeTracker will run for a total of 30 seconds but any stops before that time will be recorded correctly.

Once you start the teleop mode, the telemetry wil ask you to press `x` on your controller. Once you do that it will immediately start recording the driving.

Once it stops or you end it, you are ready to run the recording.
